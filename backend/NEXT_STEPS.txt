Add more details to the ICS file (e.g., location, time)?
Proceed with frontend integration?
Explore direct Google Calendar API integration?
Instead of downloading an ICS file each time, consider implementing an ICS feed that calendar apps can subscribe to. When your data updates, their calendars automatically update.
    
    
    
    Areas to Improve
Validation & Testing:
    Write unit tests for your database and ICS routes.
    Ensure your ICS files pass strict validators (like icalendar.org/validator.html).
Pagination & Caching:
    If you havenâ€™t implemented caching of TMDb results, consider using a Redis or simple in-memory cache to avoid repeated requests.
User Preferences:
    Let users choose which countries they care about, or let them set reminders (e.g., email notifications) for upcoming releases.
Front-End Integration:
    Build a minimal web UI where users can search, filter by year/country, then download an ICS file or directly subscribe to the calendar feed (ICS feed URLs).



Optional Direct Calendar Subscription
    Instead of downloading an ICS file each time, consider implementing an ICS feed that calendar apps can subscribe to. When your data updates, their calendars automatically update.
